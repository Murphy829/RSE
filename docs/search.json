The mirror moves back and forth, to collect measurements from one pixel in the image at a time.\nPush broom scanners, also sometimes referred to as along track scanners, use a line of detectors arranged perpendicular to the flight direction of the spacecraft. As the spacecraft flies forward, the image is collected one line at a time, with all of the pixels in a line being measured simultaneously.

In China, as the spatial planning reform of the country progresses, planning authorities are placing increasing emphasis on remote sensing and 3D GIS technology.\nFor many years there has been a contradiction between land use planning and urban planning in China. With increased urbanisation, in particular, the conflict between arable land and urban built-up areas. In recent years, Chinese officials have undertaken a reform of the planning system, combining the two into one, called territorial spatial planning. Remote sensing has changed the way of territorial spatial planning, and its powerful data acquisition, analysis, prediction and management capabilities provide data, methods and management platforms to support territorial spatial planning.Remote sensing helps to achieve a refined and intelligent management of the whole cycle of territorial spatial planning.\nPlanning policies have been integrated to form a ‚Äúone map‚Äù for territorial spatial planning based on one map, which can be opened up in layers.\n (Source:Territorial spatial planning topic: Overview of the territorial spatial planning system)"

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nBased on the understanding of the causes of distortion of remote sensing images, this week I learnt about the principles of pre-processing remote sensing image data, which are divided into correction and enhancement. I also learnt the basic concepts and specific steps of correction and enhancement by using R.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\nWhen a remote sensing sensor receives electromagnetic radiation energy from a feature, the inconsistency between the measured value of the remote sensing sensor and the actual spectral emissivity of the feature, caused by the transmission of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere and sensor measurements, is known as radiometric aberration, due to the effects of the characteristics of the remote sensing sensor itself, the lighting conditions of the feature (terrain effects and solar altitude angle effects) and atmospheric effects.\nGeometric aberrations occur when the geometric position, shape, size, orientation and other features of features on the original image do not match the requirements for representation in the reference system.\nGeometric and atmospheric corrections are pre-processing processes that address these two forms of aberration.\n (Source: Geolearn)\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric corrections\nIt is usually necessary to pre-process the remotely sensed data and remove the geometric distortion so that individual picture elements are in their proper planimetric (x, y) map locations.(Geolearn)\n (Example of Geometric corrections. Source: geography338.blog)\n\nCauses of distortions\n\nView angle (off-nadir)\n\nTopography (e.g.¬†hills not flat ground)\nWind (if from a plane)\nRotation of the earth (from satellite)\nProcess of Geometric corrections\n\nCoordinate transformation: Transformation of spatial position (image element coordinates)\n\nTake the coordinates and model them to give geometric transformation coefficients\nPlot these and try to minimise the RMSE - Jensen sets a RMSE value of 0.5  (Source: Abdul Basith)\n\nResample: recalculation of pixel grayscale values\n\nNearest Neighbor\nLinear\nCubic\nCubic spline  (Source: Peter T. Bobrowsky)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric correction is a kind of Radiometric correction. The objective of atmospheric correction is to determine true surface reflectance values by removing atmospheric effects from satellite images (Themistocleous et al., 2008).\n (Example of Atmospheric correction. Source: NASA)\n\nCauses of environmental attenuation\n\nAtmospheric scattering\nTopographic attenuation\n\nNecessary and unnecessary atmospheric correction\n\nUnnecessary\n\nClassification of a single image\nIndependent classification of multi date imagery\nComposite images (combining images)\nSingle dates or where training data extracted from all data\n\nNecessary\n\nBiophysical parameters needed (e.g.¬†temperature, leaf area index, NDVI)\nE.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and Livestock Early Warning System\nUsing spectral signatures through time and space\nTypes of atmospheric correction\n\nRelative atmospheric correction: Relative atmospheric correction (AC) methods avoid the evaluation of atmospheric components of any kind. They rely on the fact that, for one sensor channel, the relation between the radiances at Top Of Atmopshere and at ground level follows a linear trend for the variety of Earth features present in the image. This linear relation is in fact an approximation of reality, but for practical purposes it is precise enough when there are other, more important sources of error.(UT)\nAbsolute atmospheric correction: Absolute atmospheric correction (AC) methods require a description of the components in the atmospheric profile. The output of these methods is an image that matches the reflectance of the ground pixels with a maximum estimated error of 10%, provided that atmospheric profiling is adequate enough. This image can be used for flux quantifications, parameter evolution assessments, etc., as mentioned above. The advantage of these methods is that ground reflectance can be evaluated for any atmospheric condition, altitude and relative geometry between the Sun and satellite. The disadvantage is that the atmospheric profiling required for these methods is rarely available. To address this inconvenience, various absolute AC methods have been developed that have different requirements in relation to the atmospheric profiling data‚Äîand differences in the accuracy of the results. (UT)\n\nMethods of atmospheric correction\nempirical line method\nimage-based methods\n\nhistogram minimum method\n\nregression method\nradiative transfer models\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Orthorectification correction / topographic correction\nA subset of georectification, requires sensor geometry and an elevation model. Nd atmospheric correction happens before topographic correction. - georectification = giving coordinates to an image - orthorectification = removing distortions‚Ä¶ making the pixels viewed at nadir (straight down)\n (Example of Orthorectification correction. Source: esri)\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Radiometric Calibration\nRadiometric Calibration refers to the ability to convert the digital numbers recorded by satellite imaging systems into physical units. (SDSU)\n (Example of radiometric calibration. Source: Rodrigo et al., 2007)\n (Simplified schematic of atmospheric interference and the passage of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun to the satellite sensor. Source: Newcastle Univesrity)\n\nKey terms\nDigital number (DN): DN is a variable assigned to a pixel, usually in the form of a binary integer in the range of 0‚Äì255 (i.e.¬†a byte)\nRadiance: Radiance is the variable directly measured by remote sensing instruments. Basically, you can think of radiance as how much light the instrument ‚Äúsees‚Äù from the object being observed.\nReflectance: Reflectance is a property of a material (e.g.¬†reflectance of grass is a property of grass)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Joining data sets / Enhancements\n\n3.1.2.1 Joining data sets\nThis is termed ‚ÄúMosaicking‚Äù in remote sensing - but it‚Äôs not much different to merging in GIS.\nHere is an example of a Landsat 8 band 753 colour-composite without seamless mosaicing:  And here is the same image with the use of the Mosaic With Feathering tool:  (Example of a Landsat 8 band 753 colour-composite without seamless mosaicking. Source: WhiteboxDev)\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Enhancements\nIn terms of the object of action, contrast enhancement corresponds mainly to the image element, while filter enhancement takes into account the relationship between the image element and its neighbour elements.\n\nContrast Enhancement Image enhancement is the procedure of improving the quality and the information content of original data before processing.( Haldar, 2018)  ÔºàExample of contrast stretch, Source:Earth LabÔºâ\nRatio Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is used to identify burned areas and provide a measure of burn severity. It is calculated as a ratio between the NIR and SWIR values in traditional fashion. \n\n\n(Example of Normalized Burn Ratio. Source: USGS)\n\nFiltering Low pass or low frequency (averages the surrounding pixels), High pass or high frequency - enhance local variations.\nPCA To retain key information, reduce data volume and enhance or extract useful information through function transformation.\nPrincipal Component\nTransform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset\nHas most of the original information\nReduces future computation ‚Äúdimensionatliy reduction‚Äù\nThe first component will capture most of the variance within the dataset\nIn R this is from the RStoolbox packager asterPCA()\nTexture Texture: spatial variation of gray values.\nFusion Image fusion is where data from multiple sensors / sources is fused together."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThis week is an introductory course to the Google Earth Engine (GEE), GEE Code Editor website, introducing GEE from its setup and functionality.\nGEE is a powerful tool to help people understand the relationship between people and nature at a large scale, with all the Landsat, Sentinel and MODIS remote sensing data stored on GEE, and all the major remote sensing analysis algorithms integrated, and Google provides significant free computing power for users to analyse and process this data.\nIf remote sensing technology has made it possible to analyse the Earth, then the GEE remote sensing big data platform has made it feasible.\nHere are some useful tutorials resources for beginners. You can also find more advanced tutorials recommended in the ‚öîÔ∏èPractical link.\n\nGEE Guides\nWelcome to Google Earth Engine\nGee-turtorials\nCloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine\n\n\n5.1.1 Basics\n\n(A great introduction from GEE team Nick Clinton)\n\n5.1.1.1 What is Google Earth Engine (GEE)?\nEarth Engine is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business and government users.\nEarth Engine hosts satellite imagery and stores it in a public data archive that includes historical earth images going back more than forty years. The images, ingested on a daily basis, are then made available for global-scale data mining.\nEarth Engine also provides APIs and other tools to enable the analysis of large datasets.(Source:earthengine)\nGEE‚Äôs philosophy includes that ‚ÄúOften it turns out to be more efficient to move the questions than to move the data.‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllowing scientists to focus more on scientific questions rather than spending their energy on downloading and managing massive amounts of data.‚Äù\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Advantages of GEE\n\nOver 900+ geospatial datasets to choose from, supporting planetary-scale data science.\n\nGoogle Earth Engine‚Äôs data archive contains more than 40 years of historical imagery and scientific datasets, updated and expanded daily.It contains over 70 petabytes of geospatial datasets (including Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS) that you can access quickly and easily in Earth Blox‚Äôs drag-and-drop, no-code interface. Not sure what dataset to use? No worries. We will help you find the right one for your analysis.(Source: Google Earth Engine,Google Earth Engine API)\n (Source: Forest loss in Sumatra‚Äôs Riau province, Indonesia, 2000-2012. Credit: Hansen, Potapov, Moore, Hancher et al., 2013)\n\nFaster analyses with cloud processing.\n\nEarth Engine runs on Google Cloud, giving you access to high-performance computing, even from a mobile device. And since it is cloud-based, you don‚Äôt need a high internet bandwidth as you won‚Äôt be downloading large files. This is especially useful for analysts working in countries with poor or unstable internet connectivity.\n\n\nUpload your own data.\n\nYou can upload your own raster and vector data to the platform. You can also recommend datasets from the Javascript API Code Editor window by going the Help button on the top right and selecting Suggest a dataset.\n\n\n5.1.1.3 disdvantages of GEE\n\nThere are several limitations on the use of datasets in GEE.\n\ne.g., the data sets stored in GEE are not comprehensive (such as complex SAR is not included).\n\nThere is a limit to the amount of user-uploaded data that can be stored.\nRequires JavaScript and Python coding skills.\nComplex pricing.\n\nGoogle provides two pricing options. The first is based on the consumption of Earth Engine resources (compute units and storage) and the second is a monthly subscription fee based on the number of user seats with consumption limits.\n(The basics of GEE operation useful for me are covered in the opening mindmap and will not be summarised in text.)"

The future of remote sensing is not only for professional remote sensing people, but also for environmentalists, economists, sociologists and even ordinary people to analyse global problems and help find solutions from the Earth observation data of the last half century.Reminds me of GOOGLE‚ÄôS MISSION STATEMENT ‚ÄúOur mission is to organise the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful.‚Äù"
