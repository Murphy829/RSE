## Summary

This week introduces basic concepts about remote sensing, physical principles, resolution of remote sensing data and data selection constraints, and familiarity with the software we will use.

### Remote sensing

**Remote sensing is the acquiring of information from a distance**. NASA observes Earth and other planetary bodies via remote sensors on satellites and aircraft that detect and record reflected or emitted energy. Remote sensors, which provide a global perspective and a wealth of data about Earth systems, enable data-informed decision making based on the current and future state of our planet. <br/> (Source: NASA.

    -   Large area and time coverage.
    -   Frequency of updates.
    -   Easy data acquisition.
    -   Provide useful information in various wavebands.
    -   Repetitive coverage provides to monitor dynamic themes like agriculture.Stereo satellite data may be used for three-dimensional studies.

-   Aerial photos are costly if repetitive photos are required.

### Overall view of working remote sensing system

1.  The origin of electromagnetic energy (sun transmitter carried by the sensor).<br/>
2.  Transmission of energy from the atmosphere of the earth.<br/>
3.  Interaction of energy with the earth's surface (reflectance/absorption/transmission) or self-emission.<br/>
4.  Transmission of the reflectance/emitted energy to the remote sensor.<br/>
5.  Detection of energy by the sensor, converting it into a photograph may be digital or analog.<br/>
6.  Transmission/recording of the sensor output.<br/>
7.  Pre-processing of the data and generation of the data product.<br/>
8.  A collection of ground truth and other collateral information.<br/>
9.  Data analysis and interpretation.<br/>
10. Various themes, or other applications.<br/>

### Sensor

Sensors, or instruments, aboard satellites and aircraft use the Sun as a source of illumination or provide their own source of illumination, measuring energy that is reflected back. Sensors that use natural energy from the Sun are called passive sensors; those that provide their own source of energy are called active sensors.<br/>

### Electromagnetic

Electromagnetic energy, produced by the vibration of charged particles, travels in the form of waves through the atmosphere and the vacuum of space. These waves have different wavelengths (the distance from wave crest to wave crest) and frequencies.<br/>

-   EMR Interacting with Earth's surface The EMR, on interaction with earth's surface, experiences a number of changes in the magnitude, direction, wavelength, polarization and phase etc.<br/>
    -   Absorption
    -   Transmission
-   EMR Interacting with Atmospheric Before radiation used for remote sensing reaches the Earth's surface it has to travel through some distance of the Earth's atmosphere. Particles and gases in the atmosphere can affect the incoming light and radiation. These effects are caused by the mechanisms of scattering and absorption.<br/>
    -   Scattering
        -   Rayleigh scattering
        -   Mie scattering
        -   Nonselective scattering
    -   Absorption
        -   Ozone

### Data

-   There are four types of resolution that affet the quality and nature of the data a sensor collects: Spatial, Spectral, Temporal and Radiometric.<br/>
-   The select of data depends on these factors: Size of features, Date range, Revisit requirement, Spectral sensitivity, Cost.

## Reflection

This week's teaching was interesting and fundamental, showing us the potential and applications of remote sensing technology. In China, as the spatial planning reform of the country progresses, planning authorities are placing increasing emphasis on remote sensing and 3D GIS technology.<br/>

For many years there has been a contradiction between land use planning and urban planning in China. With increased urbanisation, in particular, the conflict between arable land and urban built-up areas. In recent years, Chinese officials have undertaken a reform of the planning system, combining the two into one, called territorial spatial planning. Remote sensing has changed the way of territorial spatial planning, and its powerful data acquisition, analysis, prediction and management capabilities provide data, methods and management platforms to support territorial spatial planning.Remote sensing helps to achieve a refined and intelligent management of the whole cycle of territorial spatial planning.<br/>

Planning policies have been integrated to form a "one map" for territorial spatial planning based on one map, which can be opened up in layers.<br/>
