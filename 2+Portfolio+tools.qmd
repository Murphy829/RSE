## Summary
This week we learnt about [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), both of which can be based on the R language, for tasks such as note management, slideshow creation......

## Application
One of this week's tasks was to create a slide presentation on remote sensing sensors using Xaringan.

## Reflection
Quarto is seen as the next generation of R markdown, based on other powerful features and has been growing in popularity since its release last year. quarto's beautiful blog and website examples are impressive. However, as an Obsidian user, I am deeply involved in Obsidian's rich and easy-to-use plugins and learning about Xaringan and Quarto has been an interesting experience for me!
