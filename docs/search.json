Appreciation for Dr Andrew MacLachlan’s hard work on this module. I’ll always remember attending your course.\n\n\nHi there! I am Yinhao Zhan from Shenzhen, China. I have an undergraduate degree in urban planning and have worked as a urban planner for a leading urban design instituteUrban Planning & Design Institute of Shenzhen for several years.I have a passion for geo data science, urban analysis, planning policys or practice and all things about cities.\nChiefly taking charge of regulatory planning and urban design during my work experience. However, it is insufficient for me to realize my career aspirations to work in a top urban design institution, engaging in smart city construction to optimize urban governance means and create sustainable and people-oriented cities through quantitative analysis.\nOne thing that drew me to this module was the potential of using remote sensing for multi-scale urban analysis and I thought this would be a great place to meet like-minded people.\n An illustration of the integration of green space and urban public space, drawn by me, from my urban design work project."

NASA observes Earth and other planetary bodies via remote sensors on satellites and aircraft that detect and record reflected or emitted energy. Remote sensors, which provide a global perspective and a wealth of data about Earth systems, enable data-informed decision making based on the current and future state of our planet.  (Source: NASA.

These waves have different wavelengths (the distance from wave crest to wave crest) and frequencies.\n (Source: NASA.

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThis week’s teaching was interesting and fundamental, showing us the potential and applications of remote sensing technology. In China, as the spatial planning reform of the country progresses, planning authorities are placing increasing emphasis on remote sensing and 3D GIS technology.\nFor many years there has been a contradiction between land use planning and urban planning in China. With increased urbanisation, in particular, the conflict between arable land and urban built-up areas. In recent years, Chinese officials have undertaken a reform of the planning system, combining the two into one, called territorial spatial planning. Remote sensing has changed the way of territorial spatial planning, and its powerful data acquisition, analysis, prediction and management capabilities provide data, methods and management platforms to support territorial spatial planning.Remote sensing helps to achieve a refined and intelligent management of the whole cycle of territorial spatial planning.\nPlanning policies have been integrated to form a “one map” for territorial spatial planning based on one map, which can be opened up in layers.\n (Source:Territorial spatial planning topic: Overview of the territorial spatial planning system)"
