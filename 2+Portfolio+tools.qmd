## Summary

This week we learnt about [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) [Gallery🏛️](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) [Gallery🏛️](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/), both of which can be based on the R language, for tasks such as note management, slideshow creation......

## Application

One of this week's tasks was to create a slide presentation about remote sensing sensors using Xaringan.
[My slides gitpage](https://murphy829.github.io/WeekSlides/#1).


```{r embed-xaringan, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "https://murphy829.github.io/WeekSlides/#1", ratio = "4:3")
```

## Reflection

Quarto is seen as the next generation of R markdown, based on powerful features and has been growing in popularity since its release last year. Quarto's beautiful blog and website examples are impressive. However, as an Obsidian user, I am deeply involved in Obsidian's rich and easy-to-use plugins and learning about Xaringan and Quarto has been an interesting experience for me!
