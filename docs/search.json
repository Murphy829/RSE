The mirror moves back and forth, to collect measurements from one pixel in the image at a time.\nPush broom scanners, also sometimes referred to as along track scanners, use a line of detectors arranged perpendicular to the flight direction of the spacecraft. As the spacecraft flies forward, the image is collected one line at a time, with all of the pixels in a line being measured simultaneously.

In China, as the spatial planning reform of the country progresses, planning authorities are placing increasing emphasis on remote sensing and 3D GIS technology.\nFor many years there has been a contradiction between land use planning and urban planning in China. With increased urbanisation, in particular, the conflict between arable land and urban built-up areas. In recent years, Chinese officials have undertaken a reform of the planning system, combining the two into one, called territorial spatial planning. Remote sensing has changed the way of territorial spatial planning, and its powerful data acquisition, analysis, prediction and management capabilities provide data, methods and management platforms to support territorial spatial planning.Remote sensing helps to achieve a refined and intelligent management of the whole cycle of territorial spatial planning.\nPlanning policies have been integrated to form a ‚Äúone map‚Äù for territorial spatial planning based on one map, which can be opened up in layers.\n (Source:Territorial spatial planning topic: Overview of the territorial spatial planning system)"

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nBased on the understanding of the causes of distortion of remote sensing images, this week I learnt about the principles of pre-processing remote sensing image data, which are divided into correction and enhancement. I also learnt the basic concepts and specific steps of correction and enhancement by using R.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\nWhen a remote sensing sensor receives electromagnetic radiation energy from a feature, the inconsistency between the measured value of the remote sensing sensor and the actual spectral emissivity of the feature, caused by the transmission of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere and sensor measurements, is known as radiometric aberration, due to the effects of the characteristics of the remote sensing sensor itself, the lighting conditions of the feature (terrain effects and solar altitude angle effects) and atmospheric effects.\nGeometric aberrations occur when the geometric position, shape, size, orientation and other features of features on the original image do not match the requirements for representation in the reference system.\nGeometric and atmospheric corrections are pre-processing processes that address these two forms of aberration.\n (Source: Geolearn)\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric corrections\nIt is usually necessary to pre-process the remotely sensed data and remove the geometric distortion so that individual picture elements are in their proper planimetric (x, y) map locations.(Geolearn)\n (Example of Geometric corrections. Source: geography338.blog)\n\nCauses of distortions\n\nView angle (off-nadir)\n\nTopography (e.g.¬†hills not flat ground)\nWind (if from a plane)\nRotation of the earth (from satellite)\nProcess of Geometric corrections\n\nCoordinate transformation: Transformation of spatial position (image element coordinates)\n\nTake the coordinates and model them to give geometric transformation coefficients\nPlot these and try to minimise the RMSE - Jensen sets a RMSE value of 0.5  (Source: Abdul Basith)\n\nResample: recalculation of pixel grayscale values\n\nNearest Neighbor\nLinear\nCubic\nCubic spline  (Source: Peter T. Bobrowsky)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric correction is a kind of Radiometric correction. The objective of atmospheric correction is to determine true surface reflectance values by removing atmospheric effects from satellite images (Themistocleous et al., 2008).\n (Example of Atmospheric correction. Source: NASA)\n\nCauses of environmental attenuation\n\nAtmospheric scattering\nTopographic attenuation\n\nNecessary and unnecessary atmospheric correction\n\nUnnecessary\n\nClassification of a single image\nIndependent classification of multi date imagery\nComposite images (combining images)\nSingle dates or where training data extracted from all data\n\nNecessary\n\nBiophysical parameters needed (e.g.¬†temperature, leaf area index, NDVI)\nE.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and Livestock Early Warning System\nUsing spectral signatures through time and space\nTypes of atmospheric correction\n\nRelative atmospheric correction: Relative atmospheric correction (AC) methods avoid the evaluation of atmospheric components of any kind. They rely on the fact that, for one sensor channel, the relation between the radiances at Top Of Atmopshere and at ground level follows a linear trend for the variety of Earth features present in the image. This linear relation is in fact an approximation of reality, but for practical purposes it is precise enough when there are other, more important sources of error.(UT)\nAbsolute atmospheric correction: Absolute atmospheric correction (AC) methods require a description of the components in the atmospheric profile. The output of these methods is an image that matches the reflectance of the ground pixels with a maximum estimated error of 10%, provided that atmospheric profiling is adequate enough. This image can be used for flux quantifications, parameter evolution assessments, etc., as mentioned above. The advantage of these methods is that ground reflectance can be evaluated for any atmospheric condition, altitude and relative geometry between the Sun and satellite. The disadvantage is that the atmospheric profiling required for these methods is rarely available. To address this inconvenience, various absolute AC methods have been developed that have different requirements in relation to the atmospheric profiling data‚Äîand differences in the accuracy of the results. (UT)\n\nMethods of atmospheric correction\nempirical line method\nimage-based methods\n\nhistogram minimum method\n\nregression method\nradiative transfer models\n\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Orthorectification correction / topographic correction\nA subset of georectification, requires sensor geometry and an elevation model. Nd atmospheric correction happens before topographic correction. - georectification = giving coordinates to an image - orthorectification = removing distortions‚Ä¶ making the pixels viewed at nadir (straight down)\n (Example of Orthorectification correction. Source: esri)\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Radiometric Calibration\nRadiometric Calibration refers to the ability to convert the digital numbers recorded by satellite imaging systems into physical units. (SDSU)\n (Example of radiometric calibration. Source: Rodrigo et al., 2007)\n (Simplified schematic of atmospheric interference and the passage of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun to the satellite sensor. Source: Newcastle Univesrity)\n\nKey terms\nDigital number (DN): DN is a variable assigned to a pixel, usually in the form of a binary integer in the range of 0‚Äì255 (i.e.¬†a byte)\nRadiance: Radiance is the variable directly measured by remote sensing instruments. Basically, you can think of radiance as how much light the instrument ‚Äúsees‚Äù from the object being observed.\nReflectance: Reflectance is a property of a material (e.g.¬†reflectance of grass is a property of grass)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Joining data sets / Enhancements\n\n3.1.2.1 Joining data sets\nThis is termed ‚ÄúMosaicking‚Äù in remote sensing - but it‚Äôs not much different to merging in GIS.\nHere is an example of a Landsat 8 band 753 colour-composite without seamless mosaicing:  And here is the same image with the use of the Mosaic With Feathering tool:  (Example of a Landsat 8 band 753 colour-composite without seamless mosaicking. Source: WhiteboxDev)\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Enhancements\nIn terms of the object of action, contrast enhancement corresponds mainly to the image element, while filter enhancement takes into account the relationship between the image element and its neighbour elements.\n\nContrast Enhancement Image enhancement is the procedure of improving the quality and the information content of original data before processing.( Haldar, 2018)  ÔºàExample of contrast stretch, Source:Earth LabÔºâ\nRatio Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is used to identify burned areas and provide a measure of burn severity. It is calculated as a ratio between the NIR and SWIR values in traditional fashion. \n\n\n(Example of Normalized Burn Ratio. Source: USGS)\n\nFiltering Low pass or low frequency (averages the surrounding pixels), High pass or high frequency - enhance local variations.\nPCA To retain key information, reduce data volume and enhance or extract useful information through function transformation.\nPrincipal Component\nTransform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset\nHas most of the original information\nReduces future computation ‚Äúdimensionatliy reduction‚Äù\nThe first component will capture most of the variance within the dataset\nIn R this is from the RStoolbox packager asterPCA()\nTexture Texture: spatial variation of gray values.\nFusion Image fusion is where data from multiple sensors / sources is fused together."

You can also find more advanced tutorials recommended in the ‚öîÔ∏èPractical link.\n\nGEE Guides\nWelcome to Google Earth Engine\nGee-turtorials\nCloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine\n\n\n5.1.1 Basics\n\n(A great introduction from GEE team Nick Clinton)\n\n5.1.1.1 What is Google Earth Engine (GEE)?\nEarth Engine is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business and government users.\nEarth Engine hosts satellite imagery and stores it in a public data archive that includes historical earth images going back more than forty years. The images, ingested on a daily basis, are then made available for global-scale data mining.\nEarth Engine also provides APIs and other tools to enable the analysis of large datasets.(Source:earthengine)\nGEE‚Äôs philosophy includes that ‚ÄúOften it turns out to be more efficient to move the questions than to move the data.‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllowing scientists to focus more on scientific questions rather than spending their energy on downloading and managing massive amounts of data.‚Äù\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Advantages of GEE\n\nOver 900+ geospatial datasets to choose from, supporting planetary-scale data science.\n\nGoogle Earth Engine‚Äôs data archive contains more than 40 years of historical imagery and scientific datasets, updated and expanded daily.It contains over 70 petabytes of geospatial datasets (including Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS) that you can access quickly and easily in Earth Blox‚Äôs drag-and-drop, no-code interface. Not sure what dataset to use? No worries. We will help you find the right one for your analysis.(Source: Google Earth Engine,Google Earth Engine API)\n (Source: Forest loss in Sumatra‚Äôs Riau province, Indonesia, 2000-2012. Credit: Hansen, Potapov, Moore, Hancher et al., 2013)\n\nFaster analyses with cloud processing.\n\nEarth Engine runs on Google Cloud, giving you access to high-performance computing, even from a mobile device. And since it is cloud-based, you don‚Äôt need a high internet bandwidth as you won‚Äôt be downloading large files. This is especially useful for analysts working in countries with poor or unstable internet connectivity.\n\n\nUpload your own data.\n\nYou can upload your own raster and vector data to the platform. You can also recommend datasets from the Javascript API Code Editor window by going the Help button on the top right and selecting Suggest a dataset.\n\n\n5.1.1.3 disdvantages of GEE\n\nThere are several limitations on the use of datasets in GEE.\n\ne.g., the data sets stored in GEE are not comprehensive (such as complex SAR is not included).\n\nThere is a limit to the amount of user-uploaded data that can be stored.\nRequires JavaScript and Python coding skills.\nComplex pricing.\n\nGoogle provides two pricing options. The first is based on the consumption of Earth Engine resources (compute units and storage) and the second is a monthly subscription fee based on the number of user seats with consumption limits.\n(The basics of GEE operation useful for me are covered in the opening mindmap and will not be summarised in text.)"

    "text": "6.1 Summary\n‚ÄúImage classification is the process of assigning land cover classes to pixels. For example, classes include water, urban, forest, agriculture, and grassland.‚Äù(GISGeography. 2022)\n\nUseful information extraction from EO data has long been a scientific challenge in remote sensing. Remote sensing image classification is one of the most fundamental problems in remote sensing data processing. With the increasing amount of remote sensing data at high spatial resolution, it is worthwhile to pay attention to and conduct research on how to integrate various information extraction techniques, integrate the results of multi-scale information extraction, and better extract quantitative information from various types of remote sensing data.\n\n6.1.1 Classification and regression tree (CART)\n\nClassification trees: classify data into two or more discrete (can only have certain values) categories\nRegression trees: predict continuous dependent variable\nGini Impurity: Gini Impurity is a measurement used to build Decision Trees to determine how the features of a dataset should split nodes to form the tree. More precisely, the Gini Impurity of a dataset is a number between 0-0.5, which indicates the likelihood of new, random data being misclassified if it were given a random class label according to the class distribution in the dataset.(Fatih Karabiber)\nOverfitting: Overfitting is a concept in data science, which occurs when a statistical model fits exactly against its training data. Low error rates and a high variance are good indicators of overfitting. In order to prevent this type of behavior, part of the training dataset is typically set aside as the ‚Äútest set‚Äù to check for overfitting. If the training data has a low error rate and the test data has a high error rate, it signals overfitting.\nHow to avoid overfitting ?\n\nEarly stopping: As we mentioned earlier, this method seeks to pause training before the model starts learning the noise within the model. This approach risks halting the training process too soon, leading to the opposite problem of underfitting. Finding the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù between underfitting and overfitting is the ultimate goal here.\nTrain with more data: Expanding the training set to include more data can increase the accuracy of the model by providing more opportunities to parse out the dominant relationship among the input and output variables. That said, this is a more effective method when clean, relevant data is injected into the model. Otherwise, you could just continue to add more complexity to the model, causing it to overfit.\nData augmentation: While it is better to inject clean, relevant data into your training data, sometimes noisy data is added to make a model more stable. However, this method should be done sparingly.\nFeature selection: When you build a model, you‚Äôll have a number of parameters or features that are used to predict a given outcome, but many times, these features can be redundant to others. Feature selection is the process of identifying the most important ones within the training data and then eliminating the irrelevant or redundant ones. This is commonly mistaken for dimensionality reduction, but it is different. However, both methods help to simplify your model to establish the dominant trend in the data.\nRegularization: If overfitting occurs when a model is too complex, it makes sense for us to reduce the number of features. But what if we don‚Äôt know which inputs to eliminate during the feature selection process? If we don‚Äôt know which features to remove from our model, regularization methods can be particularly helpful. Regularization applies a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù to the input parameters with the larger coefficients, which subsequently limits the amount of variance in the model. While there are a number of regularization methods, such as L1 regularization, Lasso regularization, and dropout, they all seek to identify and reduce the noise within the data.\nEnsemble methods: Ensemble learning methods are made up of a set of classifiers‚Äîe.g.¬†decision trees‚Äîand their predictions are aggregated to identify the most popular result. The most well-known ensemble methods are bagging and boosting. In bagging, a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacement‚Äîmeaning that the individual data points can be chosen more than once. After several data samples are generated, these models are then trained independently, and depending on the type of task‚Äîi.e.¬†regression or classification‚Äîthe average or majority of those predictions yield a more accurate estimate. This is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset. (Source: IBM)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Random forest\nCART decision trees are more prone to overfitting, and random forests can solve this problem to some extent. The main idea of random forest is to use randomness to generate a series of simple decision trees and combine their predictions into a final result.\nThe RF classifier is an ensemble classifier that uses a set of CARTs to make a prediction (Breiman, 2001).The trees are created by drawing a subset of training samples through replacement (a bagging approach). This means that the same sample can be selected several times, while others may not be selected at all (Belgiu, 2016).  (The random forest classifier.Source: Belgiu, 2016)\n\n\n6.1.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. (SVM is one of the best classification algorithms.(Pal & Mather. 2006))\nAdvantages:\n\nEffective in high dimensional spaces.\nStill effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\nUses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\nVersatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nIf the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\nSVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n\n\n(Source: scikit-learn)\n\n\n6.1.4 The 3 main types of image classification techniques in remote sensing\nUnsupervised and supervised image classification are the two most common approaches.However, object-based classification has gained more popularity because it‚Äôs useful for high-resolution data.\n (Source:IMAGE CLASSIFICATION IN REMOTE SENSING. 2022)"

In the practical section Landsat and MODIS data are used as examples to view temperature changes in specific regions.\n\n8.1.1 Basics\n\nWhat is (Urban Heat Island) UHI?\n\nStructures such as buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun‚Äôs heat more than natural landscapes such as forests and water bodies. Urban areas, where these structures are highly concentrated and greenery is limited, become ‚Äúislands‚Äù of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas. These pockets of heat are referred to as ‚Äúheat islands.‚Äù Heat islands can form under a variety of conditions, including during the day or night, in small or large cities, in suburban areas, in northern or southern climates, and in any season.(Source: USA.EPA, 2022)\n (Heat Island Effect Diagram, Source: USA.EPA, 2022)\n\nThe urban heat impacts\n\nSocial impacts\n\nPublic Health: Public health is the most commonly referred to impact of extreme heat, and for good reason. Extreme heat is the deadliest U.S. weather-related risk (Hondula et al.¬†2015) and accounts for a larger portion of the public health burden than most other natural disasters combined (Berko et al.¬†2014).\nEducation: While outdoor educational activities can be temporarily halted during extreme heat events, learning outcomes are also disrupted by extreme heat. A study of educational achievement data in 12,000 U.S. school districts and 58 counties found that the rate of learning decreased with the increase in hot school days (Park, Behrer, and Goodman 2021)\n\nEnvironmental impacts\n\nFossil fuel + pollution\nEach degree of ambient temperature rise the increase in peak electricity load has been estimated between 0.45 and 4.6%, corresponding to around 21 W per degree rise per person ( Santamouris et al.¬†2015)\nLandscapes: Urban landscapes require substantial investment with their planning, installation, and maintenance over their lifetimes. Increasing temperatures can limit the richness and diversity of urban vegetation (Brans et al.¬†2018) as well as negatively impact the growth of urban trees (Nitschke et al.¬†2017)\n\nEconomic impacts\n\nLocal:Melbourne first assessment 300 million (AUD) of which health 282(AUD)(AECOM,2012).\nGDP: Under low Green House Gas scenario,percent GDP lost from UHI was 0.71% (in 2050) and 1.04% (in 2100). Under very high Green House Gas scenario, percent GDP lost from UHI was 0.80% (in 2050) and 1.79% (in 2100)(Estrada et al.¬†2017)\n\nInfrastructure Impacts\n\nWater: Water use increases with rising temperatures, particularly as landscapes need more watering during hot temperatures\nEnergy: Energy use and the energy grid system are also closely connected with increasing temperatures.\nTransportation: Extreme heat also affects transportation infrastructure. Alternative transportation modes are particularly at risk if they are not designed with heat in mind.\n\n\nRelated Global policies or plans\n\nUnited Nations New Urban Agenda (2016)\n\n‚ÄúAchieving the benefits of connectivity and reducing the financial, environmental and public health costs of inefficient mobility, congestion, air pollution, urban heat island effects and noise.‚Äù\n\nUniversal Sustainable Development Goals (2015)\n‚ÄúGoal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.‚Äù\nBeating the Heat: A Sustainable Cooling Handbook for Cities\n\nIf is the first full guide on UHI that suggests: Baseline assessment; Key factors to consider(p.¬†60) such as albedo, urban form, city zoning, green cover, heat maps (that mention satellite data) - Chapter 5.

The CDC Heat & Health Tracker provides local heat and health information so communities can better prepare for and respond to extreme heat events. Use the search on the right to explore how extreme heat affects your county, populations who are at risk, and response resources.\n\n\n\n8.2.7 Recognizing hot area and which populations are disproportionately exposed to heat risk\n\nOverview\n\nThe scope of the project is to improve urban resilience to climate extremes by mapping heat risk as a function of local climate variability, urban form and fabric, and demographic and social data that reflect socio-economic sensitivity at the neighbourhood scale.\n\nWorkflow\n\nStep 1: For this be accomplished, analysis of satellite data of high spatial resolution will provide maps of the surface urban heat island which along with ground data on air temperature will support the extraction of hot spot areas in the urban web.\nStep 2: At a second stage, cluster analysis, with the use of Machine Learning (through the Google Earth Engine), will be performed to define which areas and which populations are disproportionately exposed to heat risk (‚Äúextreme heat injustice‚Äù), especially in the event of heat waves. Cluster analysis will take note of a selection of parameters, among others on temperature, building type and density, type and density of population, % of greenery, proximity to green areas, income, etc.\nStep 3: Landscape mapping will indicate locations where changes in the urban environment can mitigate heat risk and heat injustice: for instance, areas where impervious materials predominate could be landscaped with trees, pocket parks, and water features; areas where buildings are old and more sensitive to heat may be provided with subsidies for energy retrofitting; and buildings could develop green roofs or use cool material. In this way, cities improve their resilience to climate extremes. The project will concentrate to New York and Athens, although more cities may be added depending on the availability of data.\n\nDatasets\n\nSatellite images from Landsat, Aqua and Terra, Sentinel 2 and 3 (public and free)\nGround data on temperature (city data bases, ERA-5)\nCensus data on economy, housing, demographic dynamics, etc."

The penetration capability depends on the microwave wavelength and offers the possibility of inversion of surface vegetation as well as soil properties.\nData can be collected at different wavelengths and polarisations to obtain different types of information, for example about surface structure and moisture content.\nInformation can be collected over a large area at a low resolution, or over a smaller area with detailed high resolution images.\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Disvantage\n\nDue to the side-view coherent imaging method, image noise pollution is more serious.\nThe system design is complex and the amount of data processed is large, making it difficult to obtain effective feature information.\nCompared with optical remote sensing images, SAR data has low spatial resolution and poor visual effect.\nCompared with optical remote sensing images, SAR imaging technology is more cumbersome, and data post-processing is slightly more difficult.\nThe training period for technicians is long and the threshold for practice is high, requiring adequate basic knowledge of physics.\nIn the field of interferometric deformation recognition applications, mountainous areas are not well deconfined due to large deformation gradients."
