Appreciation for Dr Andrew MacLachlan‚Äôs hard work on this module. I‚Äôll always remember attending your course.\n\n\nHi! there. I am Yinhao Zhan from Shenzhen, China. I have an undergraduate degree in urban planning and have worked as a urban planner for a leading urban design instituteUrban Planning & Design Institute of Shenzhen for several years.I have a passion for geo data science, urban analysis, planning policys or practice and all things about cities.\nChiefly taking charge of regulatory planning and urban design during my work experience. However, it is insufficient for me to realize my career aspirations to work in a top urban design institution, engaging in smart city construction to optimize urban governance means and create sustainable and people-oriented cities through quantitative analysis.\nOne thing that drew me to this module was the potential of using remote sensing for multi-scale urban analysis and I thought this would be a great place to meet like-minded people.\n An illustration of the integration of green space and urban public space, drawn by me, from my urban design work project."
